Currently the PDF writer outputs formatted text but ignores the vocabulary data structures.\n\n## Problem\n- PDFHandler.write() only renders TextBlocks\n- VocabularyMetadata (lexical_map, pre_reading_words) not rendered\n- No visual representation of word families or morpheme analysis\n- DecoderTrap objects rendered as plain text, not interactive\n\n## Solution\nAdd sidebar rendering to PDFHandler that displays vocabulary information alongside main text.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### 1. Create sidebar layout system\n- Two-column layout: main text (70%) + sidebar (30%)\n- Or margin annotations for word definitions\n- Configurable placement (left/right/footnotes)\n\n### 2. Render LexicalMap in sidebar\n- Word families grouped by root morpheme\n- Color-coded difficulty tiers (easy/medium/challenging)\n- Morpheme breakdowns with origin labels\n\n### 3. Render DecoderTraps specially\n- Styled question boxes with distinct background\n- Multiple choice options in columns\n- Answer key in appendix or fold-out\n\n### 4. Render pre_reading_words\n- Warm-up section with pronunciation guides\n- Syllable breakdowns in larger font\n- Practice exercises with fill-in blanks\n\n## Technical Notes\n- Use ReportLab Table/Frame for sidebar layout\n- Consider page break handling for long sidebars\n- May need document.vocabulary.sidebar_enabled flag\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Vocabulary sidebar renders in PDF output\n- [ ] Word families grouped and labeled\n- [ ] Decoder traps have distinct visual styling\n- [ ] Layout doesn't break with long content\n- [ ] Tests verify PDF structure","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-29T15:12:10.8828888-06:00","updated_at":"2025-11-29T15:33:16.3333695-06:00","closed_at":"2025-11-29T15:33:16.3333695-06:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"Anchor Text-t8e","depends_on_id":"Anchor Text-8bt","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-29T15:13:12.9544471-06:00","created_by":"unknown"}]}
